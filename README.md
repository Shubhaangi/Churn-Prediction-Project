This project is a classification based project as the target variable only contain two values (yes or no) i.e, whether the customer churned or not.So the classifier used are classification based classifier. These are-

1.Logistic Regression

2.Support Vector Machine

3.Decision Tree

4.Random Forest

5.K Nearest Neighbor

6.Ada Boosting

7.Gradient Boosting

For further insight you can go visit the churn prediction.ipynb and can get further details there.
